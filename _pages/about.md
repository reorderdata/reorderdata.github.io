subtitle: A Dataset for Matrix Reordering
description: "Matrix reordering permutes the rows and columns of a matrix to reveal meaningful visual patterns, such as blocks that represent clusters.A comprehensive collection of such matrices and their scores for measuring the quality of visual patterns in these matrices contributes to building a benchmark for selecting or designing an appropriate reordering algorithm for a task of interest.In this paper, we build a matrix reordering dataset, ReorderData, with the goal of advancing matrix reordering techniques.This is achieved by generating a large set of diverse and representative matrices and scoring these matrices with a convolution- and entropy-based method. Our dataset contains 544,500 binary matrices and 1,089,000 continuous matrices, each featuring one of four visual patterns: block, off-diagonal block, star, or band. We demonstrate the usefulness of ReorderData through three main applications in matrix reordering: 1) evaluating different reordering algorithms, 2) creating a unified scoring model to measure the visual patterns in any matrix, and 3) developing a deep learning model for matrix reordering."

<h4><span class="font-weight-bold">What is ReorderData?</span></h4>

ReorderData is a large-scale matrix dataset built for matrix reordering. ReorderData has the following features:

- [x] Visual pattern recognition
- [x] 544,500 binary matrices and 1,089,000 continuous matrices
- [x] Four visual patterns: block, off-diagonal block, star, and band
- [x] Scores to measure the quality of visual patterns

Each matrix is of size 200x200 and symmetric.

<h4><span class="font-weight-bold">Dataset</span></h4>

We provide the ReorderData test set at [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OSSXmXupKJJgr8V0pESfGUzMTbCmnNiN) and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/reorderdata/ReorderData).

<h4><span class="font-weight-bold">Dataset Generation Pipeline</span></h4>

To ensure the representativeness and diversity of the ReorderData dataset, we first generate a set of representative matrix templates for each visual pattern. Then, based on these matrix templates, a large number of matrix variations with diverse degrees of degeneration are generated. The diversity is achieved by combining different variation methods, including index swapping and two types of typical anti-patterns: noise anti-patterns and noise-cluster anti-patterns. To accurately evaluate the quality of visual patterns in a matrix, we develop a scoring method by combining the matching capability of convolutional kernels and the disorder detection capability of entropy.

The code for generating the dataset is available at [Github](https://github.com/reorderdata/reorderdata_code).

<h4><span class="font-weight-bold">Unified scoring model</span></h4>

We build a unified scoring model based on the ReorderData dataset. This model aligns with the convolution- and entropy-based scoring method across all four visual patterns in both binary and continuous matrices and can also measure matrices of varying sizes. 

The unified scoring model is available [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OSSXmXupKJJgr8V0pESfGUzMTbCmnNiN) and [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/reorderdata/unified_scoring_model). The related code is available at [Github](https://github.com/reorderdata/reorderdata_code).

<h4><span class="font-weight-bold">Deep reordering model</span></h4>

The extensive and diverse matrices in ReorderData offer valuable supervision for training a deep reordering model. By treating the matrices with index swaps as negative samples and their ground-truth matrices as positive samples, we build a deep model for matrix reordering.

The models are available at [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OSSXmXupKJJgr8V0pESfGUzMTbCmnNiN) or [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/reorderdata/reordering_model). The related code is available at [Github](https://github.com/reorderdata/reorderdata_code).
