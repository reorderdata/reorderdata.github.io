ReorderData is a dataset built for matrix reordering. It contains 544,500 binary matrices and 1,089,000 continuous matrices, each featuring one of four visual patterns: block, off-diagonal block, star, or band.
Each matrix is of size 200x200 and symmetric.

We provide the matrix dataset ReorderData as well as the unified scoring model and the reordering models introduced in Sections 6.2 and 6.3. These can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1QAEHPqj7Tog1gpj10dfqKBwSQffRHsIX). (TODO: upload training data and models)
